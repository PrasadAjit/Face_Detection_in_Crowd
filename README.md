# Face_Detection_in_Crowd
🧠 Face Detection in Crowd
📌 Overview
Face Detection in Crowd is a computer vision project focused on accurately detecting and localizing multiple human faces in densely populated scenes. Traditional face detection systems often struggle with occlusions, variations in scale, and complex backgrounds found in crowded environments. This project leverages deep learning models to address those challenges and provide robust, real-time face detection.

🚀 Features
🎯 Robust Detection: Accurately detects faces even in heavily occluded or densely packed areas.

📷 Real-Time Processing: Optimized for real-time inference using pre-trained CNN-based models.

🧠 Deep Learning Backbone: Utilizes models such as MTCNN, RetinaFace, or YOLO with custom training on crowd-heavy datasets.

📊 Performance Metrics: Includes evaluation using precision, recall, and F1 score.
